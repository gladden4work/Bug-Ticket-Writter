--- Description 2 ---
h4. *Background*



* Merchants with high transaction volume (e.g. ~25k stock actions per item) experience long loading times or loading spinners on the stock action page.

* Previously considered solutions like:

** Filtering to last 3 months of records (found ineffective in some cases).

** Manual deletion of records (not scalable).

* After discussion, pagination is identified as the most scalable and user-friendly solution.



h4. *Problem Statement*



Stock action pages fail to load or are very slow for merchants with high stock movement volume due to the current method of loading all records at once.



h4. *Proposed Solution*



Implement server-side pagination for the stock action page, including the following:



# *Pagination Rules*

#* Default: {{Records per page = 10}}, load first 10 records.

#* User clicks {{>}} → load next 10 records.

#* If {{Records per page = 50}}, load 50 and *preload* the next 50 and 100 records in the background (for better user experience).

# *Backend Changes*

#* Move data retrieval to backend.

# *Performance Optimization*

#* Implement record preloading where feasible: 3 months?  or 250 records?
